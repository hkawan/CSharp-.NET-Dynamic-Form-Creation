# CSharp-.NET-Dynamic-Form-Creation

The purpose of the first form is to select an action (open an empty form to enter data, select a movie or create a list of jobs.) After selection, the second form will be built dynamically, then shown to execute itâ€™s job. When closing the second form, the results of processing data (stored in myData) will be shown on the first form (in lblTransfer).
